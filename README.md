# tSPM algorithm
the transitive sequencing algorithms for electronic medical records.

the R script can perform both tSPM and the traditional SPM.

a long data model with 3 columns is needed:

patient number | phenx | date

**phenx** is the column that stores all features

The R script is based on the i2b2 data model's naming convention.
needs name modifications for other data models.

the MSMR algorith will be published in its own repository.
